# CS_3321_Project
Project for CS 3321, Software Engineering, BB Mockup using C# and SQL
Need to download full project and make sure there are no errors, change the appconfig file to your local DB and then commit the SQL file provided. Use Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to ensure compatibility with project, if using something else like MYSQL you will have to change it up with the SQL adapters and add libraries accordingly. 
As of 11/13/2017 The project is working with the database, need to add functionality for student but admin side is working.
